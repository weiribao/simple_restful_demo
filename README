A few notes:

1. To run the server: 
	
	sudo npm install && node app.js

2. To run the test (assuming the server is up):

	node test.js

3. The description doesn't describe how the server should behave when duplicate object is POST/PUT. Currently it creates duplicate objects in the database.

4. I intentionally choose not to use a testing framework to make the code easier to read.
